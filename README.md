# React Minecraft

React Minecraft is a project that allows you to create Minecraft worlds using React components.
Just like React-DOM and React-Native, React Minecraft uses the React.js Framework and JSX to craft custom builds in Minecraft. With Minecraft Blocks.

## State of this project

This is a very early release of this project (you could call it a prototype), the API is still subject to change. 
Depending on the Feedback this project will be further developed to provide a stable API.

## Roadmap / Ideas: 

 * Add better component reloading without server restart
 * Add rotation and mirror possibility for blocks/sections
 * Check if we can make events (f.e. button press) work
 * If events work, add reactivity
 * If reactivity works see if functions can work
